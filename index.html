					Statement from President Joe Biden

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<q>Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter.</q>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Joe firmly and repeatedly stated that he would do no such thing, proving once again (as if any additional proof were needed) that there are preferential rules for Democrats and their favored elite compared to those imposed upon citizens.

			</div>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<q>From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department&rsquo;s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.</q>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Even if Joe did not <i>personally</i> interfere directly, it is clear that there was a massive conspiracy at the federal level to cover up Hunter&rsquo;s bad behavior and illegal activities, and to short-circuit both the investigative and judicial aspects of Hunter&rsquo;s activities. In his position at the top of the food chain, Joe must take responsibility for this conspiracy. Furthermore, Joe even crowed about some of these instances of interference.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, Hunter self-selected for prosecution with his egregious behaviors and decisions, including writing a self-implicating book and leaving evidence of his crimes on a laptop computer. As for that computer, Biden supporters in government, the <q>intelligence community,</q> and the mainstream media falsely stated for months that it was <i>not</i> Hunter&rsquo;s, and attempted to deny and hush the whole thing up in the weeks before the election in 2020
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<q>Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form.</q>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				This is huge win for 2A advocates, who have been making this point for years. We expect that this aspect of Joe&rsquo;s pardon will resurface again and again in court cases brought to secure our 2A guarantees.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.
			</p>
			<p>
				The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room &mdash; with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process.
			</p>
			<p>
				Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter&rsquo;s cases.
			</p>
			<p>
				No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter&rsquo;s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son &mdash; and that is wrong.
			</p>
			<p>
				There has been an effort to break Hunter &mdash; who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution.
			</p>
			<p>
				In trying to break Hunter, they&rsquo;ve tried to break me &mdash; and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe it will stop here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enough is enough.
			</p>
			<p>
				For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth.
			</p>
			<p>
				They&rsquo;ll be fair-minded.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here&rsquo;s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice &mdash; and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.
